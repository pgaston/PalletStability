## To use

The file open3dtest.py is meant to be used in VS Code, in jupyter interactive mode.

*This code is simply an instructive, proof-of-concept.    (Much) more work is required to take this to production.*


## Getting started

Create the conda 'stability' environment.    Then, in VS Code set that conda environment to be active - 'Python: Select Interpreter'.

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
